# Email-security-yara
This project is tailored to address the specific needs of cybersecurity enthusiasts and organizations focused on detecting email threats. With a primary focus on YARA rules, our repository is designed to compile and organize a comprehensive set of indicators of compromise, enabling effective identification and mitigation of email-based security risks. Operating under the permissive MIT License, we encourage users and organizations to freely utilize, modify, and integrate our YARA rules into their private environments, fostering a collaborative and secure email threat detection ecosystem.

As the prevalence of email threats continues to rise, our initiative seeks to centralize YARA expertise, making it easily accessible to security practitioners. By offering a curated and up-to-date repository, we aim to streamline the implementation of robust email threat detection mechanisms, ensuring that users can fortify their defenses against evolving cyber threats. Join us in advancing email security by contributing, using, and providing feedback on our YARA ruleset under the MIT License. Together, let's enhance the collective resilience against email-based security challenges.
